# CS-305-Portfolio

Artemis Financial is a financial services company that needed to strengthen the security of its web-based application. They asked for a review of their software to identify vulnerabilities and apply secure coding practices to better protect customer data and ensure compliance with industry standards.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I performed a thorough assessment of the application, identifying outdated libraries, missing encryption, and input validation gaps. It’s important to code securely because insecure software can expose companies to serious risks like data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage. Software security builds trust with customers and protects the company's long-term success.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Analyzing the OWASP dependency-check report and understanding the severity of vulnerabilities was both challenging and helpful. It taught me how to prioritize security risks and match them with effective mitigation strategies.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased layers of security by implementing input validation, encryption for sensitive data, checksum verification, and using updated dependencies. In the future, I would continue using OWASP Dependency-Check, static analysis tools, and manual code review to find vulnerabilities and select appropriate fixes.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I tested the functionality manually and re-ran the OWASP Dependency-Check after refactoring. This confirmed that the application still worked correctly and that no new vulnerabilities had been introduced during the updates.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used Maven’s OWASP Dependency-Check plugin, followed OWASP Secure Coding Guidelines, and conducted manual code review. These practices will be valuable for ensuring the security and reliability of future software development projects.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show future employers this secure coding report as an example of my ability to analyze code for vulnerabilities, apply best practices in secure development, and document professional, security-focused software improvements.
